This repo is my implementation of algorithms, puzzles, data structures, and coding exercises with a hope to help me stay sharp with my knowledge and prepare for CS technical interviews.

A file ends with lc, which means that problem is from leetcode.com

For data structures:
each data structure has 2 files.  One file is the implementation, the other is a test file.

Besides data structures and sorting algorithms, each remain file consists of 5 parts:

1. the difficult level and related topics

2. problem statement

3. solution in plain English or pseudocode

4. implementation and test cases, written in Python or Java

5. complexity analysis
